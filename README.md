#Spring Replay

Have you ever wished you could replay what happened on that fateful day when your app behaved unexpectedly. Or would you like a nice way of smoke testing with a previously recorded data set? Or do you just want to add some new annotations to your codebase?

If you answered yes to any of these questions then Spring replay is for you.

###Constraints
